CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful tool that developers use to style their websites. However, if you've taken a look at the global CSS file for this site, you might be wondering, "Why is
this CSS so weird?" In this post, we'll explore some of the reasons why the CSS might look different than what you're used to.

## What is CSS?

CSS is a language used to describe how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen. It allows developers to control layout, colors, fonts, and more. However, CSS can become complex and difficult
to manage on larger projects. This is where the global CSS file comes in.

## Why the Global CSS File Looks Weird

The global CSS file for this site might look a bit different than what you'd normally write. This is because it's designed to provide a set of default styles that can be used across the entire site.
Instead of having to write new CSS rules for each component, you can use the classes provided in the global CSS file.

This approach has several benefits:

- **Consistency:** By using the same set of styles throughout the site, you can ensure a consistent look and feel.
- **Efficiency:** It's faster and easier to use existing classes than to write new CSS rules for each component.
- **Maintainability:** When you need to make a change, you can do it in one place instead of having to update multiple CSS rules.

## Understanding the Global CSS File

The global CSS file uses a methodology called BEM (Block, Element, Modifier). This is a naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. Its goal is to help developers better understand the relationship
between the HTML and CSS in a project.

Here's a quick breakdown of how it works:

- **Block:** A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.
- **Element:** A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block.
- **Modifier:** A flag on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior.

Here's how the BEM examples would look in HTML:

```html
<!-- Block component -->
<div class="block">
  Some content
</div>

<!-- Element that depends upon the block -->
<div class="block">
  <span class="block__element">Some content</span>
</div>

<!-- Modifier that changes the style of the block -->
<div class="block block--modifier">
  Some content
</div>
```

And here's how they would look in CSS:

```css
/* Block component */
.block {
    color: #0421f4;
}

/* Element that depends upon the block */
.block__element {
    color: #6200ee;
}

/* Modifier that changes the style of the block */
.block--modifier {
    color: #bb86fc;
}
```

## Conclusion

While the global CSS file might look weird at first, it's a powerful tool for managing styles on a larger scale. By using a consistent set of classes, you can style your site more efficiently and
maintainably. So next time you find yourself writing a bunch of random classes, consider taking a page from the global CSS file instead!
